Q: Why arrays in java initialize with fixed size and can`t be dynamic?

A: Static arrays, like other static data types, are objects whose size is known at compile time.
Therefore these arrays need to be initialized at the compile time. The compiler generates instructions (decisions)
to allocate memory somehow at runtime for data, and at runtime, your code can not change or modify its decisions.
If it decided it needed 50 bytes at compile time, at runtime, you can't make it decide to allocate 60 -- that
decision has already been made.
